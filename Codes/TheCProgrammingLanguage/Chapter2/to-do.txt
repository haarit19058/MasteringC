. Write a function rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated 
to the right by n positions.  how to rotate a decimal in binary or any such similar way using bit manipulation




 In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost 1-bit 
in x. Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster version of bitcount.
