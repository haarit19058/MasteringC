# Control Flow

## Statements and blocks

- An expression such as x = 0 or i++ or printf(...) becomes a statement when it is followed by a semicolon, as in x = 0;
- Braces { and } are used to group declarations and statements together into a compound statement, or block, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. 


## If-Else statements
## Else if

## Switch Case 

## Loops while and for

## Do while loops

## Break and continue

## Goto and labels

- C provides the infinitely-abusable goto statement, and labels to branch to. Formally, the goto statement is never necessary, and in practice it is almost always easy to write code without it. We have not used goto in this book. Nevertheless, there are a few situations where gotos may find a place. The most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested structure, such as breaking out of two or more loops at once. The break statement cannot be used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop
